## [`Downloads are available in the releases page.`](https://github.com/davidalami/rockrus2022/releases/tag/v1.0.0) 
This is a shortened version of a huge password dump from [this repository](https://github.com/ohmybahgosh/RockYou2021.txt) targeting russian-speaking users. Filtering and ordering of the passwords was performed by means of machine learning algorithms (take a look in Scala and Python files if interested). [This wordlist](https://github.com/sharsi1/russkiwlst/blob/master/stat_russkiwlst_top_1M.txt) was used to create training data for binary classification algorithm.
